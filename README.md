# Regex in JavaScript: A Comprehensive Tutorial by very john



## Description.
In this Regex Tutorial, you will learn how to validate the featured email address regular expression (regex) **Regex Featured in This Tutorial:** `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`. The tutorial provides a comprehensive breakdown and explanation of each component within the regex, simplifying the validation process for easy understanding. Upon completing this tutorial, you will gain a deeper comprehension of how the regex functions to validate and confirm the entry of a valid email address.

# Overview

## The Challenge
In this challenge, you will utilize the knowledge gained from the tutorial and apply it to the creation of a comprehensive tutorial on email validation using regex. The following steps were taken to achieve this:

1. Conducted a thorough literature review on the structure and format of email addresses.
2. Identified the necessary components that need to be validated in an email address, utilizing information from peer-reviewed sources.
3. Created a regex pattern that validates email addresses based on the identified components.
4. Set up a GitHub Gist, following the instructions provided in the "Installation Process" section.
5. In the newly created Gist, composed a brief explanation of the regex pattern created for email validation, describing each component and its purpose in the validation process. This explanation was informed by academic sources and tailored for novice coders and other academics.
6. Shared the link to the Gist with others to discuss different approaches and understanding of the regex pattern.




## Assigned User Story:
```
AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
```

## Acceptance Criteria:
```
GIVEN a regex tutorial
WHEN I open the tutorial
THEN I see a descriptive title and introductory paragraph explaining the purpose of the tutorial, a summary describing the regex featured in the tutorial, a table of contents linking to different sections that break down each component of the regex and explain what it does, and a section about the author with a link to the author’s GitHub profile
WHEN I click on the links in the table of contents
THEN I am taken to the corresponding sections of the tutorial
WHEN I read through each section of the tutorial
THEN I find a detailed explanation of what a specific component of the regex does
WHEN I reach the end of the tutorial
THEN I find a section about the author and a link to the author’s GitHub profile
```


## Usage Instructions:
1. Access the deployed GitHub Gist link.
2. Read through the introductory paragraph and summary.
3. Navigate through the table of contents to explore the different sections of the tutorial.
4. Read and understand each component of the regex pattern.
5. Apply the knowledge gained from the tutorial in your own projects.

## Installation Process:
**Set up a GitHub Gist:**

1. Sign in to your GitHub account or create one if you haven't already.
2. Visit: https://gist.github.com/ to create a new Gist.
3. In the "Gist description" field, enter a brief description of the challenge, such as "Email Regex Challenge".
4. Add a new file to the Gist by clicking on "Add file" and give it a suitable name, like "email_regex_challenge.md".
5. In your newly created Gist, write a brief explanation of the regex, describing each component and its purpose in the email validation process.
6. Explain how the regex can be modified to accept new requirements, such as uppercase letters or additional special characters in the email address.

**Share your Gist:**

7. Once you have completed the explanation and modifications to the regex, save your Gist by clicking on "Create public Gist" or "Create secret Gist" as per your preference.
8. Share the link to your Gist with others to discuss different approaches and understanding of the regex.

By completing this challenge, you will not only have a better understanding of the email validation regex but also gain experience in setting up and sharing a GitHub Gist.

## Built With:
- Saiyan Pride
- GitHub Gist: [How to Create a Gist?](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists)
- Visual Studio Code: [Website](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## What I Learned:
1. Deployed my 1st GitHub Gist.
2. Built knowledge and comprehension of regex patterns for email validation.
3. Thorough breakdown on regex components.
4. Effectively communicate the regex usage and validation techniques.

### Continued Development:
1. Expanding regex patterns for additional validation use-cases.
2. Creating tutorials for regex usage in other programming languages.
3. Enhancing the tutorial with more examples and interactive elements.
4. Sharing the tutorial with the developer community for feedback and improvements.
