# Overview

## The Challenge
In this challenge, you will utilize the knowledge gained from the tutorial and apply it to the creation of a comprehensive tutorial on email validation using regex. The following steps were taken to achieve this:




## Assigned User Story:
```
AS A web development student
I WANT a tutorial explaining a specific regex
SO THAT I can understand the search pattern the regex defines
```

## Installation Process:
**Set up a GitHub Gist:**

1. Sign in to your GitHub account or create one if you haven't already.
2. Visit: https://gist.github.com/ to create a new Gist.
3. In the "Gist description" field, enter a brief description of the challenge, such as "Email Regex Challenge".
4. Add a new file to the Gist by clicking on "Add file" and give it a suitable name, like "email_regex_challenge.md".
5. In your newly created Gist, write a brief explanation of the regex, describing each component and its purpose in the email validation process.
6. Explain how the regex can be modified to accept new requirements, such as uppercase letters or additional special characters in the email address.

**Share your Gist:**

7. Once you have completed the explanation and modifications to the regex, save your Gist by clicking on "Create public Gist" or "Create secret Gist" as per your preference.
8. Share the link to your Gist with others to discuss different approaches and understanding of the regex.

By completing this challenge, you will not only have a better understanding of the email validation regex but also gain experience in setting up and sharing a GitHub Gist.
